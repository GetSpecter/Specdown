# Specdown

## Just A Markdown Flavor

Specdown combines the [original markdown specification](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) created by John Gruber, the latest and greatest flavors of markdown, various other lightweight markup languages, and new syntax for semantic notation and improved machine readability. Specdown seeks to provide the most complete set of syntax while considering both backward compatibility and future need. While Specdown may stray from full backward compatability, it is with the goal of improving speed, usability, and readability.
